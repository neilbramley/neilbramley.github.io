    <h1>About me</h1>

    <p>My <a href= "publications/neil_phd_thesis.pdf" target="_blank">PhD</a> focused on active causal learning. I explored how, through interactions with the environment and observations of its temporal dynamics, people are able to develop sophisticated causal models that they can recruit in inference, simulation and counterfactual reasoning.   I showed that interventional and temporal cues, along with top-down hierarchical constraints, can inform the the evolution and adaptation of increasingly rich causal models over extended experience.

    In general, my research uses behavioural experimentation combined with computational and cognitive modelling to better understand how people build up these causal representations, exploring the bidirectional relationship between people's current beliefs and their active information gathering behaviour.  I find that people exhibit a range of active causal learning strategies from the more heuristic exploration characteristic of children's play to highly controlled randomised controlled experiments of scientific research.  A better understanding of how people learn and exploit causal models may help us explain reasoning fallacies and pathologies like superstition, hallucinations and depression, and has the potential to inform machine-learning research on active and unsupervised structure learning.</p>

    <h2>Other areas of active research</h2>

    <p>Alongside work on active causal learning, I am involved with projects looking at: explanation in causal networks; active learning about physical properties e.g. masses and forces; optimal and greedy strategies for intervention or query selection; generalised information entropy measures; controlling complex causal systems containing delays and feedback loops.</p>

    <p>I am also interested in philosophy of mind, particularly informational and functional theories of consciousness and in clarifying the relationship between phenomenology and thinking.</p>
