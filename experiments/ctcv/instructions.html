    <h2>Continuous time control instructions!</h2>

    <p>Your task will be to learn how some causal devices work.</p>

    <p>The devices will look like this:</p>

    <img src="media/instructions/images/components.png" alt="components" style="width:200px;">

    <p>There will be many possible relationships between the components:</p>

    <img src="media/instructions/images/relationships.png" alt="relationships" style="width:200px;">

    <p>Some of the components are connected together while others are not. Your job is to work out where the connections are in each device. As soon as you believe that there is a causal connection, please make your judgment in the "Judgments" box:</p>

    <img src="media/instructions/images/judgments.png" alt="judgments" style="width:800px;">

    <p>As you can see, there are three possible responses. </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Marking "positive" means that increasing the first component increases the second component</li>
        <li>Marking "none" means that increasing the first component has no effect on the second component</li>
        <li>Marking "negative" means that increasing the first component decreases the second component</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There are <span style="font-weight:bold">23</span> devices in total.</p>

    <p>You will get to interact with each device for <span style="font-weight:bold">45</span> seconds.</p>

    <p>During this time, you will get to interact with the devices by clicking and dragging their values.</p>

    <p>The components move around with some noise, but there are no outside factors affecting their motion.</p>

    <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Note</span>:  Please do not change the zoom level during the experiment. The experiment only works properly if you have your <span style="color:red">browser zoom level on 100% throughout</span>. (You can change the zoom level to 100% by pressing "cmd+0" on a mac or "ctrl+0" on a PC.)</p>
